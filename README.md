# DFIR Training Artifacts

## Overview
This repository serves as a platform for sharing simulated intrusion artifacts used in our analyst recruitment process. Unlike real-world intrusions that we analyze on a daily basis at the DFIR Report, these artifacts are specifically created for training and evaluation purposes.

### Repository Goals
- Provide the DFIR community with a glimpse into the types of artifacts we collect and analyze in real-world intrusions
- Offer a free resource for individuals to develop and enhance their digital forensics and incident response skills
- Give back to the community by sharing knowledge and practical examples
- Enable self-paced learning and skill development in a controlled environment

## Repository Structure
```
Intrusions/
├── Simulated-Case-1/
├── Simulated-Case-2/
└── ...
```

Each case directory contains parsed artifacts in zipped format, ready for analysis.

## Accessing Artifacts
For analysts who wish to parse different artifacts or work with the raw data themselves, we provide access to the complete artifact sets through our MEGA repository.

## About the Artifacts
The artifacts in this repository have been pre-parsed and organized for easy access. They represent simulated intrusion scenarios that we use to evaluate potential analysts' capabilities in:
- Digital Forensics
- Incident Response
- Artifact Analysis
- Evidence Processing

These simulated cases are designed to provide a controlled environment for testing and demonstrating analytical skills without exposing sensitive real-world data. Whether you're an aspiring analyst, a student, or a professional looking to enhance your skills, these artifacts provide a valuable opportunity to practice and learn in a safe, controlled environment.

## ⚠️ Important Safety Notice

> **Warning:** While these artifacts are from simulated intrusions, they should be treated and analyzed with the same precautions as real malicious artifacts:
> - We are not responsible for any system compromise resulting from improper handling of these artifacts
> - Always analyze these artifacts in isolated, protected environments
> - Use dedicated analysis VMs or sandboxed environments
> - Treat all artifacts as potentially malicious, even though they are from simulated scenarios
> - Follow proper DFIR safety protocols and best practices when handling the artifacts
