# DFIR Training Artifacts

## Overview
This repository serves as a platform for sharing simulated intrusion artifacts used in our analyst recruitment process. Unlike real-world intrusions that we analyze on a daily basis at the DFIR Report, these artifacts are specifically created for training and evaluation purposes.

## Application Process
When a position has a green status indicator (üü¢) and an active JotForm link, it indicates that we are actively seeking analyst candidates.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Safety Notice

> **Warning:** While these artifacts are from simulated intrusions, they should be treated and analyzed with the same precautions as real malicious artifacts:
> - We are not responsible for any system compromise resulting from improper handling of these artifacts
> - Always analyze these artifacts in isolated, protected environments
> - Use dedicated analysis VMs or sandboxed environments
> - Treat all artifacts as potentially malicious, even though they are from simulated scenarios
> - Follow proper DFIR safety protocols and best practices when handling the artifacts
